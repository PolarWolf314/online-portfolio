                I&apos;m Aaron, a 19 year old Software Engineering student at
                the University of Auckland. I love developing robust,
                consistent, and applicable software using modern frameworks such
                as React. When I am not developing code, I will be spending time
                with the people I love, playing video games, playing music, or
                training.
